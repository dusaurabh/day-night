## Day and Night Image Classifier
#### The day/night image dataset consists of 200 RGB color images in two categories: day and night. There are equal numbers of each example: 100 day images and 100 night images.
#### We have build a classifier that can accurately label these images as day or night, and that relies on finding distinguishing features between the two types of images!
#### Dataset can be downloaded on [http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/datasets/amos/] AMOS dataset.
